-- 1. Total number of bookings made by each user using COUNT and GROUP BY
SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON u.user_id = b.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name
ORDER BY total_bookings DESC;


-- 2a. Use RANK() to rank properties by total number of bookings
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(b.booking_id) DESC) AS booking_rank
FROM properties p
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON p.property_id = b.property_id
GROUP BY p.property_id, p.name
ORDER BY booking_rank;


-- 2b. Use ROW_NUMBER() to assign a unique row number to each property ordered by bookings
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(b.booking_id) DESC) AS row_num
FROM properties p
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON p.property_id = b.property_id
GROUP BY p.property_id, p.name
ORDER BY row_num;
