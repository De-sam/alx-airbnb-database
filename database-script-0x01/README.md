# Airbnb Database Schema

This schema defines the relational structure for an Airbnb-like system including:
- Users
- Properties
- Bookings
- Payments
- Reviews
- Messages

All tables include appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints. The design follows 3NF normalization and is optimized for query performance and integrity.
